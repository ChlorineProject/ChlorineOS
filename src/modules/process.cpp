/*
 *  Here, we will code multitasking and a thread system for ChlorineOS, but first we need to understand the types of multitasking systems. For example, cooperative
 *  multitasking is a type of multitasking where a thread is ran, and when it stops using the CPU, another process is called. Preemptive multitasking is a little
 *  different however, because the processes are equally shared some CPU-usage time.
